Standfirst: After finishing my Christmas film adventures, I note some conclusions and statistics about the 19 hours of films watched over the past month.

Christmas 2013 Wrap Up

For the month of December up to Christmas, I busied myself watching a selection of festive films. Ranging from the classics ([The Muppet Christmas Carol][1]) to the strange ([Holiday in Handcuffs][2]), straddling some disappointingly non-Christmassy flicks along the way ([On Her Majesty's Secret Service][3]), I enjoyed the whole experience.   

You can find the full list of films watched, with my star-rating and a link to each review [right here][4].   

After all this joy, I thought it would be suitable to write a follow-up post looking back at some statistics.   

I watched **12 films** with an average length of **1 hour, 38 minutes** which means I watched a total of **19 hours and 39 minutes** of Christmas movies. The longest was _On Her Majesty's Secret Service_, weighing in at over two hours. The shortest was _The Muppet Christmas Carol_ which wraps itself up in 1 hour, 28 minutes.   

If I was paid minimum wage to watch each film, I would've earned Â£124 which would buy me **310 litres of milk**, which is enough to fill a couple of bathtubs! I could be _bathing_ in milk.   

## Notable mentions


There were lots of films I didn't get to watch, and several I chose not to. Top of the list of recommendations were _Die Hard_ and _Love Actually_, two films that I love far too much to fairly review. A few older films were also recommended to me that I didn't get to watch, including _The Bishop's Wife_ and _Miracle on 34th Street_.   

Lest we forget, too, the weirder films that I didn't get around to. We had planned to watch _Reindeer Games_ in which Ben Affleck becomes "the unwilling mastermind of a Christmas Eve casino heist". I'll definitely be watching that piece of joy sometime soon. I missed _Make the Yuletide Gay_, in which a gay college student has trouble coming out to his parents at Christmas; _Jack Frost 2: Revenge of the Mutant Killer Snowman_, the horror sequel that never needed to happen, and _Jack Frost (1998)_, where a son reconnects with his dead father who reappears as a snowman and slowly, tragically melts. Frankly, I made efforts to avoid all three.   

Ultimately, there are [a lot of Christmas films][5]. It was hard to pick which ones to watch and the decision was often made from convenience of what people had on DVD. I'm sorry if I missed your favourite film, but maybe I'll get round to some more next year. [Black Nativity][6] is out on DVD now, and to not review that would be sacrilege.   

## Stats


Here's an interesting grid of some common themes across the movies, and which ones hit the mark:   

**[Interesting grid of common themes][7]**   

You'll notice that, according to this rudimentary system, the most Christmassy film was _The Santa Clause_, scoring in all categories. Scoring no points were _Shaft_ and _On Her Majesty's Secret Service_ (which should come as no surprise), but also _Holiday in Handcuffs_ which is a bit of a shame as it at least tries to be festive.   

## Conclusion


I _did_ enjoy watching all these films, despite my general dislike for Christmas. A lot of them were really nice, caring films that help you to get in that all important festive spirit. I saw quite a few with friends, and it was great to hang out with them, centring an evening around watching a movie and using this blog as an excuse to chill.   

Picking a favourite film from the selection would be like picking a favourite child, and mine would be _The Santa Clause_. It embodies the Christmas spirit, and manages to keep its humour whilst focussed around serious issues of divorce and broken families. My least favourite was _Home Alone: The Holiday Heist_ whose only redeeming feature was the appearance of Malcolm McDowell.
