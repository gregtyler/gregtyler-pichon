Standfirst: There are so many Christmas films. So, so many. This year, I'm going to watch some of them and tell you what I think.

Christmas 2013 Film List

There are so many Christmas films. So, so many. From the [musical version of A Christmas Carol][1] starring Kelsey Grammer to [Home Alone 5][2], by God do we like cashing in on the festive spirit. Sky Movies even have [a TV channel][3] dedicated to the damn things.   

Now I've often quite publicly voiced my opinions about Christmas. In case you don't know, there's a touch of the Ebenezer about me. However, I do love films. And my love for films will outweigh my displeasure over Christmas any day. So this Christmas, I want to get into the Christmas spirit by watching some of the best (and worst) Christmas movies.   

I'm going to rate each movie on its Christmas spirit, its cast list, how suitable it is for the family, and the quality of the Christmas music used throughout.   

Below is the list of films I've watched so far, plus a link to their writeups. Please do suggest any more in the comments or on Twitter [@gregtyler][4].
