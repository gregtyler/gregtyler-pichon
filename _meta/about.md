About

I'm primarily a web developer and designer, though I turn my hand to as much as I can. At the moment I work for the University of Edinburgh creating various academic and corporate systems, most of them hidden away from the public.

This site contains various articles across a variety of topics, trying to highlight things that I'm interested in. From [watching lots of Christmas films][1] to [highlighting talks I find interesting][2] to [TV show reviews][4]; there's a variety of content, all awkwardly overlapping.

If you want to get in touch, I'd love to hear from you:

You can find me on Twitter, [@gregtyler][5].

I'm also on Facebook, as [TheGregTyler][6].

If social media isn't your bag, you can email me at hello @ this website.
