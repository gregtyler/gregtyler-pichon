About

I'm a front-end web developer and designer, with the odd bit of full stack. I work for the University of Edinburgh creating various academic and corporate systems, most of them hidden away from the public. I work on a bunch of side projects like a [note-taking app][simply-notes] and tools for [digital humanities][bevis].

This site contains various articles across a variety of topics, trying to highlight things that I'm interested in. From [watching lots of Christmas films][1] to [highlighting talks I find interesting][2] to [TV show reviews][4]; there's a variety of content, all awkwardly overlapping.

If you want to get in touch, I'd love to hear from you.

You can find me on Twitter, [@gregtyler][5] or email me at hello @ this website.
