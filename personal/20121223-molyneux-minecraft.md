Peter Molyneux gives an excellent analogy between Minecraft and Lego

From the 2 Player Productions documentary "Minecraft: The Story of Mojang", [Peter Molyneux][1] gives an amazing analogy of how Minecraft has inversely charted the change in Lego.   

> "It's really interesting how Lego at the moment is like traditional games design. It's: Buy the box, open the box, turn to the instruction sheet, make the models, stick it on the shelf, buy the next box. That's _exactly_ like traditional game design: Buy the game, go through the challenges, finish the challenges, stick it on the shelf, buy the next game.   
  
"Where Lego _used to be_ just a big box of bricks and you used to take the bricks, pour them on the carpet, and then make stuff. And that's exactly what Minecraft is."

  
[Minecraft: The Story of Mojang][2] is available now for $8 (~Â£5), and also for free on the Pirate Bay. It's well worth a watch.
