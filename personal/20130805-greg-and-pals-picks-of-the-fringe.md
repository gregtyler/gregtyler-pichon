Standfirst: This year's Edinburgh Fringe has over 2,500 shows across 273 venues. Me and some mates pick out the ones we personally recommend.

Greg and Pals' Picks of the Fringe 2013

Ah, the [Edinburgh Fringe Festival][1] is back! As a resident of the city, the Fringe brings equal parts joy of all the shows you can see and pain of all the tourists suddenly filling the streets. I like to think I'm more on the "joy" bandwagon, but give it four weeks and we'll see if I'm still feeling it.   

Anyhow, every year lots of great magazines and websites set out to review as much as possible. They do a really good job, but I like getting advice from friends rather than strangers. So this Fringe I'm asking some of my mates to list the shows they'd recommend and tell us why! Below you can find some of the top shows of the Edinburgh Fringe, as recommended by **Greg and Pals**.   

I'll be updating this as often as I can, so check back in through the month.   

## Cronin's picks (@[cronino][2])

### [The Adventures of Alvin Sputnik: Deep Sea Explorer][3] (Theatre)
_Underbelly, Bristo Square_   
I've never had to try so hard not to just openly cry in laughter/happiness/sadness.   

![BEASTS cast photo](/edfringe-beasts.jpg ":right BEASTS: If you are in Edinburgh and don't see it, I think Cronin will actually be personally offended.")

### [BEASTS][4] (Comedy)
_Pleasance Courtyard_   
**Cronin** BEAAAAAAAASTS!   
**Greg** Yeah, Paul's already recommended that (see below), anything else you'd recommend?   
**Cronin** BEASTS! Why aren't you watching it right now?   
**Greg** It's not on right now, Cro. But I'll see it soon. I promise.   
_(Pause)_   
**Cronin** BEAAASTS!   
**Greg** This feature was an awful idea.   

### [Jekyll & Hyde][5] (Theatre)
_Assembly Roxy_   
Quite surreal, but really good. The woman is awesome. See it right now.   

### [Making News][6] (Theatre)
_Pleasance Courtyard_   
Satirical comedy play. Not hysterical, but full of a lot of funny stuff.   

## Greg's picks (@[gregtyler][7])
![McEwan Hall interior](/edfringe-mcewan-hall.jpg ":right Hot Dub Time Machine: You get to have a rave in this amazing venue. (pic: Ryan Hamilton)")

### [Fast Film Noir][8] (Theatre)
_theSpace @ Venue 45_   
I only got a ticket for this via a friend who booked it by accident, but it turned out to be a really slick, clever play. The production was really well put together, with wonderful performances from the cast, excellent lighting and some fantastic music (I love electroswing).   

### [High Plains (A Western Myth)][9] (Theatre)
_Underbelly, Cowgate_   
Physically, it's a dude sitting in a chair for an hour. But if you enjoy well-performed monologues, this is well worth seeing.   


### [Hot Dub Time Machine][10] (Music)
_Underbelly, Bristo Square, Weekend evenings_   
I'm totally biased about this event, because it took place in the room where I graduated, and I will take up any opportunity to party in there in a heartbeat. HDTM plays songs chronologically from 1954 to 2013, which sounds awesome, and in my opinion totally lives up to that expectation.   

## Matt's picks
As far as I'm concerned, Matthew is a Fringe expert. He always seems to know what the best comedy shows around are. I reckon he's secretly on the circuit, so has checked out all these acts in advance. Whilst this would sort of be cheating, I'll let it slide since I've got no real evidence to prove it.   

### [Pajama Men - Just the Two of Each of Us][11] (Comedy)
_Assembly Roxy_   
Comedy theatre by two outstanding performers who interweave ridiculous characters and outlandish mime in a mesmerising and achingly hilarious hour.   

## Paul's picks (@[paulhorrocks][12])

### [BEASTS][4] (Comedy)
_Pleasance Courtyard_   
Best sketch comedy I've seen - fantastic delivery with beautifully linked recurring jokes, could not stop laughing from the off.   

## Ryan's picks

### [Joe Lycett - If Joe Lycett Then You Should've Put a Ring On It][13] (Comedy)
_Pleasance Courtyard_   
A 20-something bisexual comic with an erratic sense of humour. A definite 5/5 for this young guy, he's got it nailed on he head. Great audience involvement. If you're going to see it in 2013, take a fan with you - the venue is roasty toasty! _[Ed: Bonus points for practical advice!]_
