[Video] Alexander Bruce about the development of Antichamber

In his GDC 14 session _Antichamber: An Overnight Success, Seven Years in the Making_, Alexander Bruce talks about the history of his game Antichamber and how much work he put into its success.   

This is a motivating, moving and fascinating talk. If you're at all interested in making video games it's an absolute must. If you're not, I think there's still a myriad of things to take away. Alexander Bruce is an excellent speaker who brings real passion to a story that clearly means so much to him.   

The talk is around 40 minutes, plus ten of questions and answers.
