Standfirst: Over the past two days, many mathematicians in Edinburgh went to their final lectures and workshops of four years. Together we made it through the horrors of Group Theory, Probability and the almost comical organisation of final year projects; but it's hard to look back now and not think of it as the most best four years so far.

Fourth Year Photo

Over the past two days, many mathematicians at Edinburgh University went to their final lectures and workshops of four years. Together we made it through the horrors of Group Theory, Probability and the almost comical organisation of final year projects; but it's hard to look back now and not think of it as the best four years so far.   

On Thursday a load of us got together with a camera and our good friend Matthew Crisp took a photo to cement some of those memories.   

I thought it would be nice to get the names of everyone in the photo so here, with a few embarrassing omissions, is a list of _some_ of the great people I got to study with.
