On user experience and desire:
 - Users want to do it in their own time
 - Users want to be free to do whatever actions (e.g. "share", "add comment", "annotate", "save for later" as well as navigation, and in-application tasks (preview, add rule))
 - DPT editor is littered with buttons

 - Can we do something more programmatic?
 - At one point are we asking people to program?
 - Distinguishment from programming: you don't need assumed knowledge. How do we ensure that?
