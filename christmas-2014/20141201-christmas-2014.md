Standfirst: It's that time of the year again where I watch lots of Christmas films to get into a festive spirit! Check back throughout the month as, with the help of some friends, I catalogue some of the Winterval's best and worst films.

Christmas 2014 Film List

Last year I watched a series of Christmas films - from classics to pure trash - in order to get myself into more of a festive spirit. I had such a good time, in fact, that I'm doing it again this year! All new films, some added twists to keep the process fresh, it should be a fun month! (If you missed it, you can catch up on last year's films [here][1].)   

As before, the selection of films is going to be far-reaching. We'll see some classics, but we'll also go over some of the more left-field flicks out there. This year a horror film will be showing up, whilst the Muppets will be going on a new adventure. We'll be watching films in black and white, and in 3D.   

If you have any suggestions, please do write them in the comments below, or tweet me [@gregtyler][2]. If I can't fit them in this year, maybe they'll make it to the 2015 wishlist!
