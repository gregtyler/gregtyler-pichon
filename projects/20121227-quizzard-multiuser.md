Quizzard gets multiuser editing!

For the past couple of days (I'm not much of a Christmas person), I've been working on live multiuser editing for Quizzard. This means that quizzes with more than one quizmaster (like the one I run), will be able to have more than one user editing the questions and scores at the same time, with those details being updated live on the other user's screen.

There are still a few bugs to iron out here and there, but this is a great step forward!
