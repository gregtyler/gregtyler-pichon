Standfirst: How to access Path if you're not a member of the University of Edinburgh

Accessing Path from outside Edinburgh University

You've probably been directed to this page because you would like to look at Path, an application developed at the University of Edinburgh that is only immediately available to members of the University. Fortunately, this page will quickly take you through how to get an "EASE Friend" account to take a look at Path and other University systems yourself.

This is all completely above board and intentional use of the system. This guide only exists because the ability to create such an account isn't properly advertised.

## Get started with EASE Friend

Short version: Go to https://www.ease.ed.ac.uk/friend/ and follow the instructions.

Long version: You'll be asked to enter your email address, which you'll ultimately use to log in. Do so, agree to the University's computing regulations and wait for an email to be sent to your inbox. This will link you to a registration form where you'll need to re-enter the email address and select a password.

You will then be able to use this email address/password to log in to EASE. Once you have done so, you can access Path at the link below:
**https://path.is.ed.ac.uk/**
